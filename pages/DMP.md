# **Data Management Plan**

# Project Description: 

Our collection is focused on Haunted Locations in Oregon. We welcome those who are curious to know more about the paranormal and interested in Oregon’s rich haunted history; furthermore, folklore enthusiasts, history buffs, and paranormal investigators can use our collection to travel to different haunted locations for an eerie adventure. This website features photographs and articles to provide insight into the legends and histories of the most spooky locations in Oregon. Our information comes from archival sources crafted by amateur photographers, historians, and fellow travelers. From abandoned hospitals to underground tunnels, our website is sure to have something any ghost enthusiast will find intriguing. Whether you are a skeptic or a true believer, we invite you to explore our collection and investigate the mysteries yourself. 

# Personnel, Roles & Responsibilities:

Project Manager: Jayna Cronkrite, Second-Year English Major, submits assignments and keeps the group on track.   
Repository Manager: Nahla Wilson, Third-Year English Major, customizing GitHub repository and uploading photos.  
Collection Manager: Kenzie Lyons, Third-Year Political Science Major, customizing metadata and reviewing file details.

**Responsibilities:**

These are our general roles. The division of roles allows us to cover all bases and by having an expert on each front, attention to detail is achieved.

If a group member is absent on a project day we will communicate with them via text or email and update them on our current progress. If we happen to fall behind or get off schedule we will plan to meet up outside of the allotted time to discuss how to move forward and catch up on anything that we should need to.

# Expected Data: 

We used Google Drive to gather our data and organize it in a way that is shareable. Through this platform, we were able to store uploaded photos, the Google spreadsheet for our project, and other Google documents. In addition to Google Drive, we also utilized the software, GitHub, where we uploaded our Google spreadsheet and selected photos to create a functional and informational website. Our CollectionBuilder website is the final amalgamation of our collected data.

# Period of Data Retention: 

We plan on retaining our data until this term ends. We do not plan on keeping up with our data after the fact. If our Google Drive and Google Sheets were taken away, our repository would only exist as long as GitHub is functioning. 

# Data Formats and Dissemination:

Our collected photos are all in .JPEG format, which were then uploaded to our GitHub repository. We have a total of 21 photos, adding up to 11.2 MB. All photos are taken from places like Creative Commons which allow users to access photos online that are free to all people to use however they intend. When using photos with this licensing we do not have to worry about copyright restrictions. 

Dissemination is possible through the use of GitHub. These items can be accessed through our GitHub repository which can be reached here: [https://nahlaw.github.io/lib350m-hauntedlocations/](https://nahlaw.github.io/lib350m-hauntedlocations/). 

# Data Storage and Preservation of Access:

We plan on keeping our data on Google Sheets. If we wanted to ensure that our information was properly preserved we could utilize a research repository like Zenodo. We will not be doing that for this project.
